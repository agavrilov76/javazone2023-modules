# Practical experience of using Java Modules

20 min

# Abstract

Java Modules is one of the most prominent Java platform features. It was introduced in Java 9 and
since have slowly been adopted by Java developers. Modularity gives better control over third-party
dependencies, clean and logical code structure and ability to create custom application specific
Java runtime(s).

In this talk I want to share my experience in building and running modular applications.

Starting with Java Modules is as simple as adding a module-info.java file to the source path.
Module is an aggregation above java packages with a unique name. The modern IDEs and build tools
like Maven will automatically recognize it and help out to get started. Only classes from the
required modules will be visible for the application at compile time. Only specific modules can
access the application classes via reflection at runtime time.

What is the difference between class-path and module-path? Do you need to declare module info for
tests? How does resource loading work across different modules? How to package and containerize the
modular application? Join me on my talk if you want to know!

# Touch points

- A brief history of Java Platform Module System (JPMS)
- Discuss JPMS design goals:
    - Explicit declaration of dependencies between modules at compile time and runtime time
    - Strong encapsulation for the Java platform and applications
    - Scalable modular Java platform
    - Improved performance
    - Backwards compatibility
- Consider a sample Java project consisted of an application and a library. The app can read
  text resource files and parse JSON
- Add a `module-info` to the library
- Add a `module-info` to the application set the module name, add the `requires` and `exports`
  sections
- Discuss readability and visibility
- Fix the package split issue in the library code
- Open reflection module access to Jackson
- Add `uses` to get the custom Jackson module to become visible
- Fix the resource loading issue
- Discuss the difference between encapsulated and not-encapsulated resources
- Run tests and note the difference between `module-path` and `class-path`
- Build a bundle with the maven assembly plugin, show how to run the app using the `module-path`
- Create an executable distribution using `jlink`
- Create a Docker container and run it
- Be aware of:
    - Use latest version of tooling
    - Encapsulation rules are difficult
    - Unit and integration test coverage is important
    - Auto-modules don't work `jlink`
- Q/A

# Talk structure

- Start the talk with a few slides covering two first points above
- Switch to demo code using the IntelliJ IDEA community edition
- Use the code from the `plain` directory gradually transforming it into a modular application
  following the points above (the result is in `modules` directory)
- Demo `jlink`
- Demo docker containers
- Go back to the final summary slide
- Q/A
